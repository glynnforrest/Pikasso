# Intro

Pikasso aims to offer a simple and portable solution for dealing with
images in web applications. It is intended to be as lightweight as
possible, only including functionality for resizing, rotating and
converting between image formats.

Pikasso will remain portable by transparently switching between
ImageMagick and GD, loading ImageMagick if possible, then falling back
to GD.

# Usage

Coming soon.
